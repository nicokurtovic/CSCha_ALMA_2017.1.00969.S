# CSCha_ALMA_2017.1.00969.S
CS Cha circumbinary disk as observed by ALMA Band 7 (345GHz) during ALMA cycle 5. Published in Kurtovic et al. (2022)

The project initially aimed to search for the millimeter emission from CSCha B, which was undetected. The dataset, however, contains one of the deepest observations towards a circumbinary disk.

These datasets are presented in Kurtovic et al. (2022) \

## CSCha files
Fits files have the dust continuum emission in ALMA Band 7, and also the 12CO J:3-2 continuum subtracted. Be aware of the following details:
- Check for channel width, pixel size, and beam size in the header.
- Do not use these fits files for astrometry with other epochs.
- Calibration scripts are described in the paper.
- The moment maps and the channel maps are downloaded together. The moments were calculated with the package bettermoments.
